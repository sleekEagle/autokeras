# autokeras

This tests the auto ML library autokeras.
Dataset used : Berlin emoDB vocal emotion recognition database

##cnn_method.py 
uses a modified version of a CNN form paper "Ealuating  deep  learning
architectures for Speech Emotion Recognition‚Äù by Fayek et.al. 
It trains and validates the model. It could achieve an accuracy of 0.62

##autokeras_method.py
use auto ML package autokeras to build a CNN architecture which is suitable for the given data. 
After fully training the resultant model I could only achieve an accuracy of 0.53
